## Explanations
### TBNAME
`TBNAME` can be considered as a special tag, which represents the name of the subtable, in a STable.

Get the table name and tag values of all subtables in a STable.
```mysql
SELECT TBNAME, location FROM meters;
```

Count the number of subtables in a STable.
```mysql
SELECT COUNT(TBNAME) FROM meters;
```

Only filter on TAGS can be used in WHERE clause in the above two query statements.
```mysql
taos> SELECT TBNAME, location FROM meters;
             tbname             |            location            |

 d1003                          | California.SanFrancisco        |
 d1002                          | California.LosAngeles          |
 d1001                          | California.LosAngeles          |
Query OK, 4 row(s) in set (0.000881s)

taos> SELECT COUNT(tbname) FROM meters WHERE groupId > 2;
     count(tbname)     |

### _QSTART/_QSTOP/_QDURATION
The start, stop and duration of a query time window.

### _WSTART/_WSTOP/_WDURATION
The start, stop and duration of aggegate query by time window, like interval, session window, state window.

### _c0/_ROWTS
